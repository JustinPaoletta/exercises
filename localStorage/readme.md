#In this exercise, I created a GUI email and password field that interacts with the browser's local storage. 

Tips:

 - There is no submit button because the function to save data to local storage is triggered by the keyup event in the email field.

 - The password field in no way interacts with local storage object.

 - the button to clear the email address from local storage is only visible when the email address field has more than one character entered.
